# ARTHUR: Arduino Radio Telemetry HAB Update Routine
> Maria Hill: What does S.H.I.E.L.D. stand for, Agent Ward?

`ARTHUR` is the brains of a high altitude balloon (HAB) flight computer. While many of the components are specific to my build, my hope is that this will be configurable enough to let you swap in whatever you're using, or at least act as a jumping off point for you.

**This is not fully functional. Please do not send this up in a balloon until at least v1.0.**
